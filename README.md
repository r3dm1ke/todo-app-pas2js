# TODO App
This repo hosts a TODO app, written in Pascal. It uses [pas2js](https://wiki.freepascal.org/pas2js) to compile to JavaScript. This is a companion repo for an article I have not written yet. You can view the live version [here](https://r3dm1ke.github.io/todo-app-pas2js/).

You can find the pascal source code in `Todo.pas`. `Todo.js` is a compiled JS file and you do not want to see it.
